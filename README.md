# (New) Assignment 3

I created a repository in GitHub, made a second branch, and converted my Week 2 Assignment CSS into Sass by separating each piece into its proper file within the file structure.  I learned how to use Sass Watch for file compression.  I created Sass variables for color and typography and applied them.
